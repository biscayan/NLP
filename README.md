# Stemming
## Introduction
NLTK module provides a stemming function, and it is very convenient.  
However, it does not help for us to understand the principle of stemming.   
Thus, I did not use the module and implement it based on the \*\*poter stemming algorithm\*\*.

I refer to the paper, which was released in 1980.
